This is my first post on my new ~~fake~~ blog! ~~How exciting!~~ How strange!
At least I will become markdown master.

In order to get started with clojure just follow this instruction:

1. go to [repl.it](https://repl.it/)

- choose the clojure language
- copy paste the following code
  ```clojure
  (println "Hello World")
  ```
- Click "Run" (or hit "Ctrl" + "Enter")

My congratulations! Your brain is officially expanded... A little bit...
